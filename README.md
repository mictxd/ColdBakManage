generally,offline backup files need some manage. eg. duplicate , multi harddriver need keep synchro. manage in files is simple,but bored.

#  roadmap

1 define major and normal place.
think there is major place , its back up files. most time it's poweroff state. When you need just power on, copy some file from it. Then power off. Your activity is on normal place. When the file changes ,you power on major place, back up file.
this will help manage the place.or many places.
2 duplication. There are so many tools, but need click and type so many times.and repeat it is bore. this tool will remember the major place and check if duplication file exists.and report where it is . after your choice,you can free more spaces 'safelly'.
how this tools think files duplication?by sum MD5 OR SHA1 OR SHA256.
3  in normal place,you can define same directory to be backup.like cloud disk tool[drop box?].it will entirelly synchro in the directory in major place.
4  basically just soso.
